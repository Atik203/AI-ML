This is because the numerator of Bayes' formula (true positives) increases substantially with higher disease prevalence, while the denominator (all positives) increases at a slower rate since false positives remain relatively constant. With more diseased people in the population, a positive test result is much more likely to indicate actual disease rather than a false alarm.
